# Quiz: What type of JavaScript Hacker are you? (RESULTS)

**I made a sample iOS mobile app for JS HACKERS** https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiz-what-type-javascript/id1153368376?ls=1&mt=8

## If you want to see what hackers think about these statements:

1. It's a waste of time to learn any other language than #JavaScript.The future is with JS :)

2. Framework vs. #hypermodular development is like planned economy vs. free market.

3. Information asymmetry can best be broken by making everything #transparent.

4. Programming is the new literacy, everyone should learn it. All other jobs will be #automated.

5. Employment is for kids. Grown ups are #self-employed.

6. With #VR all the jobs will be remote. On-site gatherings will be for fun.
